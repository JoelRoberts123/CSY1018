       <p>This first term of learning web develpoment has been an interesting and challenging one. I have been tasked with creating a working website 
           that shows off my HTML and CSS skills that  i have learned and adapted throughout the course of the first term. I had to create 6 HTML pages 
           with the correct CSS coding implemented. The first page is a landing page that serves as an intorduction to the website as well as my team members
           that i had to collaborate with in order to complete this page. This took a while as i was still new to the code and couldnt find any team mates
           for a couple of weeks but online tutorials from sites such as codepen.io helped out a lot.
       </p>
       <p>The second page consisted of creating a glossary consisting of 50 web development terms that i had learned throughout my time.  </p>
       <p> The third page consisted of comparing 3 web developer jobs online from a site called CWjobs.com. This was fairly easy to do as the site has a filter option so 
           it was easy to find comparable web developer jobs. As for the CSS of this page, i already had most of it from my previous pages so there was </p>>
           much need for more CSS coding.
           </p>
           <p>page 4 was about talking about different online HTML and CSS editiors and comparing them. I spoke about sites such as codepen, Thimble and Flexbox froggy.
               I compred these different siters to see which ones were best suited for new coders and which were suited for more experienced coders by comaparing attributs
               such as their usability. </p>
