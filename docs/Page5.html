    <h4>One site that i looked to for inspiration was apple. Apple's website is one that i like because
        It is not clustered. The website consists of a white background with little images/text used to make the user
        feel welcome and not feel bombarded with a cluster of text/images. I like this layout and have gone for a similar
        approach in my website by using a white background and a simplistic approach to make the user feel welcomed and not
        bombarded with stuff. Another thing about Apples website is the black navigation bar at the top of the page. It stands out from the rest of the
        page and the text inside is easy to read. I have gone for a similar design in my work by having the navigation bar in the same place and 
        going for a similar font style/colours. 
    </h4>
    <h4>Another website that i looked to for inspiration was a website called stuffandnonsense.co.uk. This was one of the websites that we looked at
        during class. The reason i like this site is because it also follows the codes and conventions that i mentioned previously with Apple. This website
        also has a clear white background like apple so that the text is easily readable and makes the website look cleaner. This website also did not use masses of 
        text so the user would not feel overwhelmed. To balance out the lack of text, this website has included a variety of pictures so the website does not
        look bare and bland. I hsve tried to take the same approach by adding pictures onto nearly every page so that the pages do not look completely baron.
    </h4>
    <h4>Another website that i looked at was paravelinc.com. This was another website that we looked at in class just like the previous website. This website
        has a very basic homepage following some of the codes and conventions mentioned previously. Firstly, this website has a white background like the previous
        websites to make the website look clean. This website also had very little content on it. All it has is one big image along with their logo, a navigation bar
        and a footer. Having this little content on the landing page works well as the user does not feel bombarded with infomation. It is alos clear to the user what the
        webpage is about and this makes the user want to explore the website. The other pages consist of a decent balance of text and image keeping the convention of
        white background and clear, black text along with images to fill up some of the white spaces. I like the way the website uses little text and images
        for a clear website so i have decided to go with this style in my text
