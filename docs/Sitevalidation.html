       <p>This first term of learning web develpoment has been an interesting and challenging one. I have been tasked with creating a working website 
           that shows off my HTML and CSS skills that  i have learned and adapted throughout the course of the first term. I had to create 6 HTML pages 
           with the correct CSS coding implemented. The first page is a landing page that serves as an intorduction to the website as well as my team members
           that i had to collaborate with in order to complete this page. This took a while as i was still new to the code and couldn't find any team mates
           for a couple of weeks but online tutorials from sites such as codepen.io helped out a lot.
       </p>
       <p>The second page consisted of creating a glossary consisting of 50 web development terms that i had learned throughout my time. i found the majority
           of terms on the lecture slides and found a few of them online. </p>
       <p> The third page consisted of comparing 3 web developer jobs online from a site called CWjobs.com. This was fairly easy to do as the site has a filter option so 
           it was easy to find comparable web developer jobs. As for the CSS of this page, i already had most of it from my previous pages so there was 
           much need for more CSS coding.
           </p>
           <p>page 4 was about talking about different online HTML and CSS editiors and comparing them. I spoke about sites such as codepen, Thimble and Flexbox froggy.
               I compred these different siters to see which ones were best suited for new coders and which were suited for more experienced coders by comaparing attributs
               such as their usability. </p>
        <p>Page 5 consisted of describing good ui features from other various webpages and why i have decided to use some of these features in my own work. For this, i looked 
            at a few websites that we had previously looked at in class as well as looking at a few other biiger sites such as Apple. All of the websites that i looked at
            had the same classic UI conventions such as a clear white background and a nice balance of text and images. I decided to include these UI conventions in my
            website as i thought is worked well.

    <p>The picture to the left shows me using a CSS validator to check my HTML code for errors. As you can see, the HTML validator will scan the HTML for erros and then it
        will state what line the error is on and wha the problem is. For example, the first waring stated that i had an empty heading on line 12 that consisted of the h1 tags. 
        I was easily able to correct this by going back into VS code and correcting this problem. The next error stated that i did not insert a space where i should have and therefore,
        this game up as an error, This is was an easily correctible mistake as all i did was i went back into VS code and inserted a space where i previously had not. I did this with
        each page of my HTML and CSS code.
