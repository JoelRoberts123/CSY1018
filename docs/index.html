    <h4>hey guys, Joel Roberts here and i am the first member of the team that i shall be introducing you to. I'm 18 years 
        old and am currently making this website using the knowledge and skills that i have learned from the first term of web development in order 
        to achieve a good grade. So far i have found the first term of web dev quite interesting as well as fun and am keen to see
        what the rest of the year has in store for me. A few of my hobbies include gaming and football as well as watching only the 
        best TV shows such as Game of thrones, prison break, stranger things and a whole lot more.

    <h4>This sexy young fella is Mike Duffin and he is the second member of the team that i will be introducing you to. This young man has opted to
        do the same course as me (web tech security) and with regards to this specific project, he was the main contibuter  when it came to making the 
        video below about good examples of user interface design as he was the one who wrote the script for the video as well as edit it. Well, that's
    when he's not out in the town getting hammered. you can probably guess what he likes to do in his pastime from that previous sentence... </h4>

    <h4> Here we have the worlds strongest man, also known as Elliot Garner and he is the final member of the team that i will be intorducing you to.
        He is a little bit older than me and he only attends University part time as he has another job on the side that he does to make money.
        This man was very helpful in terms of giving me inspiration as to how my website should look by showing me other websites that he had looked at for 
        designing his website.

    <h4>Finally this is the video that me and my team mates made when discussing good practices of current ui. This short video explains some of the 
        websites we turned to when looking for inspiration for our own website as well why we liked these specific features. we decided to shoot this
        video in the library due to the volume conditions we experienced in other areas. This allowed our voices to be heard as best as possible.
         This video took a few attempts to film due to my inability to read the script properly. Prepare for a bloopers real coming soon....
