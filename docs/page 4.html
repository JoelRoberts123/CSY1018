    <p> This is my page showing of the bests websites to learn about HMTL and CSS and learning how to code </p>
    
    <p> One site that i find really useful id Codepen.io, this is a really useful site for beginners for learning how to code as well
        as a really helpful site for experienced developers as it provides thousands of demos and examples of code for both HTML and CSS. Another
    advantage of codepen is that it is completely free to signup!</p>
    <p>Another site i found to be useful in learning code is a site called Thimble. Thimble is an online code editor that allows users to sign up 
    and create new code projects for free. Thimble has a side preview that will constantly update when any changes are made to the html or css code
    so the user can always see what their page will look like in browser mode. This makes thimble really user friendly and one of the better websites
    for coders. This site also pre loads code for new users to help them with their websites. </p>

    <p>Flexbox froggy is another online tool that can help new and experienced coders with their coding but this time thsi comes in the form of a game.
        Flexbox froggy has 24 levels and to pass each level, the player must use their coding knowledge to get the frogs onto the lilypads that match the 
        correct colours. This game tests the players current CSS knowledge and also teaching new code at the same time as each level provides a more challenging puzzle 
        as the game goes on. The player wins the game when he/she completes level 24. This is a fun interactive experience as well as an educational one and is one of the
        more entertaining ways of learning code.
